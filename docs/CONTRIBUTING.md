## Conventions

- **PHP 8.1+** — use match expressions, named arguments, typed properties
- **No framework** — intentionally lightweight (AltoRouter + PDO + plain PHP views)
- **PSR-4 autoloading** — namespace `BBS\` maps to `src/`
- **SQL in controllers** — queries live in controller methods, not in model classes
- **No ORM** — direct PDO via the `Database` class
- **Bootstrap 5** — loaded via CDN, custom styles in `public/css/style.css`
- **Migrations** — sequential numbered files in `migrations/`, run via `php migrate.php`

---

## Adding a Migration

1. Create `migrations/NNN_description.sql` (or `.php` for data migrations)
2. SQL migrations are executed as-is; PHP migrations are `require`'d
3. Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` for idempotency
4. Run: `php migrate.php`

---

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-thing`
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally (dev server + create a plan + trigger a backup)
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why

---

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue on GitHub with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- PHP version, OS, browser
- Relevant log output (server log, agent log, browser console)

---

## Areas That Could Use Help

- **Testing** — there are no automated tests yet (unit tests, integration tests)
- **Agent features** — bandwidth throttling, pre/post backup hooks
- **UI polish** — responsive improvements, dark mode
- **Packaging** — Docker image, DEB/RPM packages
- **Internationalization** — the UI is English-only

---

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Write clear commit messages. Don't break the scheduler.
