# Borg Backup Server

![Dashboard](public/images/borgbackupserver.png)

A self-hosted web application for centrally managing [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/) across multiple Linux and macOS endpoints. A lightweight agent polls the server for tasks over HTTPS, backs up over SSH to the server, and reports progress back. No inbound connections to endpoints required — works behind firewalls and NAT. Includes a setup wizard for zero-config installation.

## Features

- **Agent-based architecture** — endpoints initiate all connections; no inbound ports needed on clients
- **SSH with append-only security** — agents back up over SSH but cannot delete existing archives
- **Setup wizard** — browser-based installer configures database, admin account, and storage in minutes
- **Real-time progress** — live progress bars during backups
- **File-level restore** — browse archive contents in a collapsible tree, restore individual files or entire directories
- **Download archives** — extract and download files as .tar.gz directly from the browser
- **Plugin system** — extend backups with pre/post hooks for databases, applications, and custom scripts
- **Database plugins** — MySQL, PostgreSQL, and control panel dumps (cPanel, Interworx) with point-in-time restore
- **Flexible scheduling** — hourly to monthly intervals, multiple plans per client, manual trigger
- **Backup templates** — pre-configured directory sets for common server roles
- **Retention policies** — per-plan prune settings (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- **S3 offsite sync** — mirror repositories to S3-compatible storage (AWS, Wasabi, Backblaze B2)
- **Multi-user** — role-based access (admin sees all, users see own clients)
- **Two-factor authentication** — TOTP-based 2FA with recovery codes
- **Queue management** — concurrent job limits, cancel/retry, progress tracking
- **Encrypted passphrases** — repository passwords encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- **Email alerts** — SMTP notifications on backup failure, agent offline, storage low
- **Dashboard** — backup charts, server stats, active jobs, auto-refresh
- **Server self-backup** — daily automated backup of BBS itself with optional S3 sync

## Quick Start

Start with a fresh **Ubuntu 22.04+** server, then run:

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver/main/bin/bbs-install
sudo bash bbs-install --hostname backups.example.com
```

The installer handles everything — packages, Apache, MySQL, SSL, and cron. When it finishes, open the URL and the setup wizard walks you through the rest.

See the **[full documentation on the Wiki](https://github.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver/wiki)** for installation details, agent setup, configuration, and usage guides.

## Docker

Run BBS in a Docker container — no OS dependencies to install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver.git
cd borgbackupserver
docker compose up -d
```

Get admin credentials from the container logs:

```bash
docker compose logs bbs
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and log in.

### Configuration

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to customize:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public URL (used by browsers and agents) |
| `SSH_PORT` | `2222` | SSH port — must match the host-side port mapping |
| `BBS_VERSION` | `latest` | Release tag, e.g. `v1.0.0-RC5`, or `main` for dev |
| `ADMIN_PASS` | *(random)* | Admin password (first run only) |

BBS needs two ports: **HTTP** for the web UI and API, and **SSH** for borg backup data transfer. The `SSH_PORT` environment variable must match the host port in your SSH port mapping so agents know which port to connect to.

Updates can be applied from the Settings page in the web UI, or by restarting the container (`docker compose restart`).

All data is stored in the `bbs-data` Docker volume (`/var/bbs`): borg repositories, MariaDB database, SSH keys, and configuration. Back up this volume to protect your data.

## Architecture

```
Endpoint                                 BBS Server
  [bbs-agent.py]                         [PHP + MySQL + borg]
       |                                      |
       |--- register (hostname, OS) --------> |  HTTPS
       |--- download SSH key ---------------> |  HTTPS
       |                                      |
       |--- poll for tasks -----------------> |  HTTPS
       |<-- backup command + passphrase ----- |
       |                                      |
       |  [borg create over SSH] -----------> |  SSH (borg serve --append-only)
       |                                      |
       |--- progress (files, bytes) --------> |  HTTPS (every 5s)
       |--- status (completed/failed) ------> |  HTTPS
       |--- file catalog (batch) -----------> |  HTTPS
       |                                      |
       |            [server runs borg prune]  |  local (server-side)
       |                                      |
       |--- poll for tasks -----------------> |  (next cycle)
```

- **HTTPS** for control plane (task polling, progress, status)
- **SSH** for data plane (borg backup/restore via `borg serve`)
- **Append-only** — agents cannot delete existing archives; pruning runs server-side
