# Borg Backup Server

A self-hosted web application for centrally managing [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/) across multiple Linux and macOS endpoints. A lightweight agent polls the server for tasks over HTTPS, backs up over SSH to the server, and reports progress back. No inbound connections to endpoints required — works behind firewalls and NAT. Includes a setup wizard for zero-config installation.

## Features

- **Agent-based architecture** — endpoints initiate all connections; no inbound ports needed on clients
- **SSH with append-only security** — agents back up over SSH but cannot delete existing archives
- **Setup wizard** — browser-based installer configures database, admin account, and storage in minutes
- **Real-time progress** — live progress bars during backups
- **File-level restore** — browse archive contents in a collapsible tree, restore individual files or entire directories
- **Download archives** — extract and download files as .tar.gz directly from the browser
- **Plugin system** — extend backups with pre/post hooks for databases, applications, and custom scripts
- **Database plugins** — MySQL, PostgreSQL, and control panel dumps (cPanel, Interworx) with point-in-time restore
- **Flexible scheduling** — hourly to monthly intervals, multiple plans per client, manual trigger
- **Backup templates** — pre-configured directory sets for common server roles
- **Retention policies** — per-plan prune settings (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- **S3 offsite sync** — mirror repositories to S3-compatible storage (AWS, Wasabi, Backblaze B2)
- **Multi-user** — role-based access (admin sees all, users see own clients)
- **Two-factor authentication** — TOTP-based 2FA with recovery codes
- **Queue management** — concurrent job limits, cancel/retry, progress tracking
- **Encrypted passphrases** — repository passwords encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- **Email alerts** — SMTP notifications on backup failure, agent offline, storage low
- **Dashboard** — backup charts, server stats, active jobs, auto-refresh
- **Server self-backup** — daily automated backup of BBS itself with optional S3 sync

## Quick Start

Start with a fresh **Ubuntu 22.04+** server, then run:

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver/main/bin/bbs-install
sudo bash bbs-install --hostname backups.example.com
```

The installer handles everything — packages, Apache, MySQL, SSL, and cron. When it finishes, open the URL and the setup wizard walks you through the rest.

See the **[full documentation on the Wiki](https://github.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver/wiki)** for installation details, agent setup, configuration, and usage guides.

## Architecture

```
Endpoint                                 BBS Server
  [bbs-agent.py]                         [PHP + MySQL + borg]
       |                                      |
       |--- register (hostname, OS) --------> |  HTTPS
       |--- download SSH key ---------------> |  HTTPS
       |                                      |
       |--- poll for tasks -----------------> |  HTTPS
       |<-- backup command + passphrase ----- |
       |                                      |
       |  [borg create over SSH] -----------> |  SSH (borg serve --append-only)
       |                                      |
       |--- progress (files, bytes) --------> |  HTTPS (every 5s)
       |--- status (completed/failed) ------> |  HTTPS
       |--- file catalog (batch) -----------> |  HTTPS
       |                                      |
       |            [server runs borg prune]  |  local (server-side)
       |                                      |
       |--- poll for tasks -----------------> |  (next cycle)
```

- **HTTPS** for control plane (task polling, progress, status)
- **SSH** for data plane (borg backup/restore via `borg serve`)
- **Append-only** — agents cannot delete existing archives; pruning runs server-side
